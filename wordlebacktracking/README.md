# Sudoku Backtracking

This code helps solve the Wordle by taking in a partially complete guess and any other letters which are confirmed to be in the solution, and outputting all possible answers.
You could input an empty guess with no extra letters which are confirmed to be in the solution, but the code will output the entire dictionary.
This code  demonstrates my knowledge of recursive backtracking, implemented in c++.


See wordle.cpp for the actual recursive function.
